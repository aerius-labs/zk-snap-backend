# ZkSnap: Verifiable on/off chain DAO voting with ballot privacy using storage proofs

## Introduction
**ZkSnap** is an innovative solution that revolutionizes the way DAO voting is conducted.

Traditional voting systems often expose participants to the bandwagon effect, surveillance, and coercion, compromising the integrity of the decision-making process. ZkSnap changes the game by employing zk proofs, which allow individuals to cast their votes securely and anonymously. Your voting preferences remain confidential, safeguarding your autonomy and protecting against any external influence.

Our unique integration of storage proofs guarantees the transparency and accuracy of the voting power of individuals. By leveraging storage proofs, we are able to verify the integrity of the voting individual and the exact voting power that they hold.
